**Domain:** Video Analytics, CCTV

**Problem Statement:** KVH-009 - Advanced CCTV Analytics Solution.

## Revolutionizing public safety for global impact.
Our solution harnesses the power of live CCTV feeds to autonomously identify and report incidents related to street crime, violence, burglary, theft, infiltration, and unauthorized access. Operating in real-time, the system promptly generates email alerts with key details, including incident type, detected weapon(s) and timestamp. Furthermore, our solution maintains a robust database, enabling comprehensive incident tracking and facilitating the generation of insightful reports. This database will serve as a valuable resource for law enforcement analysis and strategic planning.
